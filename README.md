Project Idea:
Theme: eCommerce
Plan: Shopping website

Front Page:
Includes a front page having a slideshow that dynamically displays advertisements to show the most popular products and huge discounts and many item categories to find certain items which encourages users to explore further.


Game Section:
The game section is where users with an account can select and play a fun game every day that can earn them points to discount products and win prizes as well. This creates a sense of user engagement and anticipation which encourages them to return regularly.

Spending-Based Discounts:
Includes a feature where spending a certain amount for every order provides a discount that is larger depending on amount spent. This then incentivises larger purchases and increases the average order value. Order more > More Discounts > Happy User

Account Page:
Includes an account page that allows user to customize account, check their order history and claim rewards that are yet to be claimed in their rewards section
